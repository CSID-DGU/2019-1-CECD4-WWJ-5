On the first page of our story
the future seems so bright
And this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why
I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked
schemes and you take death
to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
even though you lost your mind
Just gonna stand there
and watch me burn
But that's alright because
I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
and hear me cry
But that's alright because
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ooh I love the way you lie
Now this gravel in our voices
glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war
you'll always win
even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables
from your hand
With violet words and empty
threats and it's sick that
all these battles are
what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there
and watch me burn
But that's alright because
I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
and hear me cry
But that's alright because
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh I love the way you lie
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run
but I don't wanna ever leave
Til the walls are goin' up
in smoke with all our memories
This morning you wake
a sunray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay
in the wake of destruction
hush baby speak softly
tell me I'll be sorry that you
pushed me into the coffee
table last night
so I can push you off me
try and touch me
so I can scream at you
not to touch me
run out the room
and I'll follow you like
a lost puppy
baby without you
I'm nothing I'm so lost hug me
then tell me how ugly I am
but that you'll always love me
then after that shove me
in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on
two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many
knives we put
in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's backs
'cause we're that lucky
together we move mountains
let's not make mountains
out of molehills
you hit me twice yeah
but who's countin'
I may have hit you three times
I'm startin' to lose count
but together we'll live forever
we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy we're nuts
but I refused counselin'
this house is too huge
if you move out
I'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground
ain't shit you can do about it
with you I'm in my fukin' mind
without you I'm out it
Just gonna stand there
and watch me burn
But that's alright because
I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
and hear me cry
But that's alright because
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
