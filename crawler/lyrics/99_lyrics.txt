You were the popular one the
popular chick
It is what it is now I'm
popular ish
Standing on the field with your
pretty pompons
Now you're working at the movie
selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but
I never went wrong
Cause I'm putting down my story
in a popular song
Said I'm putting down my story
in a popular song
My problem I never was a model
I never was a scholar
You were always popular
You were singing all the songs
I don't know
Now you’re in the front row
Cause my song is popular
Popular I know about popular
It's not about who you are or
your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular I know about popular
And all that you have to do is
be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
Catch up cause you got an awful
long way to go
Catch up cause you got an awful
long way to go
I was on the lookout for someone
to hate
Picking on me like a dinner plate
I'd hit during classes and in
between them
Dunk me in the toilet sound to
that cleans
You tried to make me feel bad
with the shit you do
It ain't so funny when the
joke's on you
Uh the joke's on you
And everyone's laughing got
everyone clapping asking
How come you look so cool
Cause that’s the only thing
that I’ve learned at school
So that’s the only thing I’ve
learned at school
My problem I never was a model
I never was a scholar
You were always popular
You were singing all the songs
I don't know
Now you're in the front row
Cause my song is popular
Popular I know about popular
It's not about who you are or
your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular I know about popular
And all that you have to do is
be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
Catch up cause you got an awful
long way to do
Catch up cause you got an awful
long way to go
All you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
All you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
All you ever need to know
Popular I know about popular
It's not about who you are or
your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular I know about popular
It's not about who you are or
your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular I know about popular
And all that you have to do is
be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
All you ever need to know
