I GUESS?\nI'm sorry but I love this song! XDim koreanis anyone else korean other than me\r\nThis is the second Big Bang song I've ever listened to (as far I know). The first was Wedding Dress. Both very good!I don't care how old this is, it's amazing!! <3 <3 <3@ttttrigg3r it spelled tagojingmal , where t is without aspiration and ng in the middle is nasal soundAny Koreans wanna help me pronounce these words?? \"I'm so sorry but i love you da geo-jis-mar\" How would I pronounce those last syllables? It sounds like \"da gah gi mai\" is that right?its harder to read big bang korean lyrics cause they have this weird accent to them and they drag out certain wordsthe first one i ever listened is last farewell!wow korean words how u did that so awesome lol\r\ni just love this song^^@kikyo062498 sorry\n@kikyo062498 샤답\n@kikyo062498 새답\n@mindsprawl im a yonguk saram too :)awesome sound qualitie (Y)only 1 person disliked it= justin bieber fanso awesum. i really wish for a japanese versionI Can read Korean and understand most of it : ) (yong-guk- saram-im-ne-da : )@reinehahaha000 regardless whether they misspell it or not, it's really stupid so it's \"easier\" to understand in their tongue bc i get ppl who facebook me and try to type in korean and it's so poorly written that idk what they're saying... so if they want to know how to write korean, they should try to learn how it's properly written- that's all i'm trying to say.\n\ni didn't mean to offend you -_-I love Big Bang... K-Pop makes me wanna learn korean. xDTHAN YOU SO MUCH FOR THE HANGUL. it rly pisses me off when ppl just do romanization because it is CRAP. ppl misspell the pronunciations and then ppl can only read them and they're like \"Oh, we know korean!\"\nHAHAH. my ass. -_-\ni'm so damn proud to be korean.thank you for the hangul lyrics <3 i'm so proud to be korean ;) able to understand and read ~@jeanessa13xox me too^_^\r\ni'm hoping to take korean lessons soon though:DMy god I lovee big bang, the bestest ever ever ever!\n\nThey're so talented! :D And I want so so so badly to learn korean just so to understand big bang's songs for myself!! :)@demdemhappy  it means hello over the phone.@demdemhappy it pretty much means \"hello?\" lol.dam TOP has such a deep voice hes like the background ^^i love korean people and this is why i love myself♣♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥great song! btw, i think it's yoboseyoh in the beginning. it means hello when u are answering calls.cause Big Bang is awesome. that's why this video has more than 10k views :DLOL I can read korean but not that fast, and I don't even understand what I'm reading haha..... anyways...I LOVE this song...I'm so sorry but I love you I just can't lie... :)Big Bang is AWESOME..!!!I always loved when JaeSuk used to sing this with Daesung lol.Woooooo Big Bang is Hawt <3Ahhh♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥  big bang ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥fuuuuckingg lovee Big Bang.♥thx just wut i wuz lookin 4
